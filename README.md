# ConCearch
Abstract:
ConSearch is a simple, but effective application (app) to be able to quickly see upcoming concerts.  This app can get information from your location, a certain venue you prefer, or similar artists of an artist you already enjoy.

ConSearch will start by getting basic information about you and your preferred artists, venues, or both.  Once you register, you will be directed to the “Home” screen where you will see information of upcoming concerts based on your preferences you selected while registering and, if allowed, concerts around your location.  If you choose one of the items on the “Home” screen, the app will show more detailed information about that upcoming concert.

Another feature on the “Home” screen is a search bar.  This will allow you to search in a certain location or maybe a certain artist that is not one of your preferred choices.  The app will also allow you to change, add, or delete your preferences if they change later.  This app will not have a feature to buy tickets for concerts, but may provide a link to a website that provides tickets if available.


Introduction:
ConSearch is a concert information application (app).  This app is basically designed to store preferred artists, locations, or venues and provide information based off those preferences.  The app will use the user’s phone’s location, if allowed, and the user’s stored preferences and show information based on that data on the main app page; the “Home” screen.  To get more detailed information, the user clicks on the link for the concert.  The app may (functionality pending) be able to provide a link to purchase tickets for the concert if he/she so chooses.

The motivation for ConSearch is to provide a functional, and preferably aesthetically pleasing, application for a school project using PHP and SQL for storing user profile information and accessing an API, which is a source of information accessible on the internet for concerts.  The API the app will send queries to is the SongKick™ API.

The highest priority of ConSearch is to be an app that provides high quality information about concerts without being complicated or riddled with advertisements (ad, ads).  This app will have no commercial value, and thus, will not be under any pressure of fiscal performance or ad integration.  ConSearch will be the solution for those who want concert information quickly without the distraction, and annoyances, of ads or corporate agendas.
Background:
Looking in the Google Play Store, you will find applications (app, apps) that provide concert information, but most, if not all, have a goal to sell tickets to those concerts to you.  That type of app can be appealing, but there are people who do not want to be sold tickets, which again is the main goal of these apps, but would rather just get information on upcoming concerts.  All too often, apps are riddled with advertisements (ad, ads) that pop on the screen in both obtrusive and unobtrusive ways.  Many of these ads have nothing to do with what the general idea of the app and are very annoying.

ConSearch is the solution to these problems.  This app is simple, but effective.  It provides data gathered by SongKick™ which they provide through their API.  (www.songkick.com/developer)  ConSearch will be able to display information requested from this API such as upcoming events, past events, event details, venue details, and similar artists.  The SongKick™ API will also be able to provide information based on a user’s location. (www.songkick.com/developer/upcoming-events)  ConSearch will be developed with the goals of simplicity, information gathering, and non-annoyance in mind.
